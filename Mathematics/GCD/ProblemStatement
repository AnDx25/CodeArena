Given two numbers a and b find the greatest common divisor between those two.

Ex: 10, 15:
	Prime factor of 10 := 1x2x5
	Prime factor of 15 := 1x3x5
    common factors=1 and 5 
    but greatest common divisor is 5

Here three Approaches have been solved :
	Naive
	Basic Eucleadian Approach
	Optimized Eucleadian Approach

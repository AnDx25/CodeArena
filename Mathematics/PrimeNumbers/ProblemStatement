Prime Numbers

Any Number which has only two factors either 1 or the number itself which could divide the number completely then such a number is
called as Prime Numbers

Ex : 2,3,5,7,11,13..

Numbers which are not prime are called composite numbers which have factors other than 1 and number itself.

2 is the only even prime number

1 is a number which is neither prime nor composite.
